# Tip calculator 

#### You're given a CSS file for a tip calculator, and you need to implement the component using React.

The tip calculator should have 3 number inputs in this order, each with an associated label:

- Bill: The total price of a bill, defaulting to 50.
- Tip Percentage: The percentage that the user is tipping, defaulting to 18.
- Number of People: The number of people splitting the bill, defaulting to 1.

The paragraph below displays the tip per person, rounded to two decimal places. 

The tip per person is calculated by dividing the total tip by the number of people splitting the bill. For example, if the total tip was $9.00 and two people are splitting the bill, the second paragraph would read: "Tip Per Person: $4.50".

Your component has already been rendered to the DOM inside of a #root div directly in the body with the CSS imported.
